Pre-requisites: 
===============

python >= 2.3
twisted >= 1.3
pycrypto >= 2.0 
wxPython >= 2.6.1

Installation:
=============

flud can be installed via setuptools ('python setup.py install') or via rpm or
debian packages (recommended).

If pre-built packages are not available for your platform, source RPMs
(.rpm.src) are available for building them.  RPMs can also be generated via
'python setup.py bdist_rpm'.  Debian/Ubuntu packages are created by running 
'dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot' while in the top directory.  (Users of platforms
other than those for which packages are available are encouraged to submit
built rpm/deb/other packages, which will be made available for others to use,
with credit going to the packager.)
