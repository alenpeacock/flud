Pre-requisites: 
===============

python >= 2.3
twisted >= 1.3
pycrypto >= 2.0 
wxPython >= 2.6.1
gnu automake, autoconf, gcc, etc.

Installation:
=============

flud can be installed via setuptools ('python setup.py install') or via rpm or
debian packages (recommended).

If pre-built packages are not available for your platform, source RPMs
(.rpm.src) are available for building them.  RPMs can also be generated via
'python setup.py bdist_rpm'.  Debian/Ubuntu packages are currently created with
the 'alien' tool.  (Users of platforms other than those for which packages are
available are encouraged to submit built rpm/deb/other packages, which will be
welcomely included for others to use, with credit going to the packager.)
