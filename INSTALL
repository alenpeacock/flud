Installation:
=============

In its current form, flud is meant to run inside its own directory; you may
unpack the distribution wherever you see fit.  There is no install script.

Before invoking a flud node, you must, however, install the ldpc wrappers
needed for erasure coding.  Instructions on doing so are located within the
coding/ directory contained within this distribution.
