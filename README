flud backup, svn snapshot 
==========================================

This is an svn snapshot of flud backup.  The software is very much a
work in progress, and major components of the architecture are not complete.
But there should be enough here to run some interesting experiments.

Installation
============

Before starting a flud node, you will need to build and install the ldpc libs
and python wrappers contained in the flud/coding directory of this
distribution.  Follow the directions in the flud/coding/README to perform this
rite.

Running
=======

To start up a flud node, enter the flud/ directory and do:
$ python FludNode.py <bootstraphost> <bootstrapport>

(if this is the first node in the flud network, you can omit the
bootstraphost/port.  When the public flud network becomes more generally
available, an alternate mechanism will be used to automatically find and use
it)

See http://www.flud.org/wiki/index.php/Testing_Utilities for instructions on
running some of the test suites, as well as utilities to automatically spawn
many instances of FludNode in your own private flud network.

Feedback
========

All discussion, feedback, and bug reports should be directed to the flud-devel
mailing list at flud-devel@flud.org (archive and subscriber information at
http://flud.org/mailman/listinfo/flud-devel_flud.org).
