/* This module implements operations on matrices of mod2 elements (bits,
   with addition and multiplication being done modulo 2).  The matrices
   are stored with consecutive bits of a column packed into words, and 
   the procedures are implemented where possible using bit operations 
   on these words.  This is an appropriate representation when the matrices 
   are dense (ie, 0s and 1s are about equally frequent). 
  
   All procedures in this module display an error message on standard 
   error and terminate the program if passed an invalid argument (indicative
   of a programming error), or if memory cannot be allocated.  Errors from 
   invalid contents of a file result in an error code being returned to the 
   caller, with no message being printed by this module.
