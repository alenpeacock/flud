This contains the zfec/zfec/zfec directory from the zfec project, available at
http://allmydata.org/source/zfec/, as well as documentation from zfec/zfec
(COPYING, README.txt, TODO)

Also contains fludfilefec.py, which is filefec.encode_to_files() and
filefec.decode_from_files() with slightly modified API (encode returns a list
of filenames that it produced on success or None on failure, decode returns
True on success)
